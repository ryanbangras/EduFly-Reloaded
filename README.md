# EduFly

The goal of this project is to develop an online platform that simplifies administrative tasks for secondary school teachers in Singapore. Leveraging student learning devices, the app centralizes communication and documentation, helping to reduce the administrative burden on educators. This allows teachers to dedicate more time to their core responsibility of educating and guiding students.

### Option B: Run on Localhost:

#### 1. Setting Up API Keys

To enable connections to the databases, place the `secret.env` file, which contains the necessary API keys, into the project’s root directory. This file can be obtained from the group’s shared submission documents. Ensure this file is correctly positioned to allow seamless integration and secure database access.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

##### Backend
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### 3. Start Backend Server
Run the backend server:
```bash
node app.js
```

If setup is successful, the console should display:
```
Connected to Homework Database on MongoDB Atlas
Connected to Medical Certificate Database on MongoDB Atlas
Server running on http://localhost:3000
```

#### 4. Serve the Frontend
To serve the frontend files, you can use http-server.

##### Using http-server
1. Install http-server globally:
```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

3. Start the server:
```bash
http-server -p 5500
```
